Non-recursive **GNU make**-based build system.

Provides rules for C/C++ library/application. Allows hierarchical makefile inclusion.

== example

The `makefile` for building a C++ application with `prorab` is as simple as follows:
```makefile
include prorab.mk

this_name := myapp # this will be the executable file name

this_cxxflags += -Wall
this_cxxflags += -DDEBUG

this_cflags += -Wall

this_ldlibs += -lpthread

this_srcs += main.cpp myapp.cpp legacy.c

$(eval $(prorab-build-app))
```
